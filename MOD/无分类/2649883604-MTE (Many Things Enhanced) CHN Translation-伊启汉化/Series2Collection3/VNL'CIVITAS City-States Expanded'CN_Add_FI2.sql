It flourished as a political and trading center, and during this period several covered bazaars were built in the city. These domed marketplaces have become a symbol of the city, with 4 surviving to this day, the largest of which is the Trading Dome of Tak-i Zargaron, which housed the city's jewellers. Similar Trading Domes can also be found in nearby Samarkand and Tashkent."

It is believed to have gotten its name from the oasis area it is located in, but scholars disagree as to the origin of that name, with some claiming it comes from a Sogdian word meaning 'Place of Good Fortune' and others tracing it to the Sanskrit word 'Vihara' - meaning a Buddhist monastery."

With its numerous mosques and madrasas, Bukhara also rose to became a major intellectual center of the Islamic world."

Nevertheless, the city - as the capital of the Emirate of Bukhara - continued to play an outsized political role as an important piece of the so-called Great Game between the Russian and British Empires as they shought to carve out spheres of influence in Central Asia. Eventually it became part of the Russian Empire and later part of the Soviet Union. Today the city's historic center is a UNESCO World Hertitage Site, encompassing many of the city's beautiful mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums."
