		"【译者注：正在翻译……】[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]San Antonio is one of the largest and oldest cities in both the Spanish New World and the Modern United States, and is by far the oldest, largest, and most culturally significant cities in both the former Republic of and the State of Texas. After passing through the hands of various indigenous cultures for thousands of years, the region finally became home to the Payaya Indian group that lived in the San Antonio River Valley. These natives later enslaved a shipwrecked explorer named Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, before he managed to limp his way back to Mexico City."

		"Several expeditions passed into the region of Texas in the following century-and-a-half, and the area that would become San Antonio became of vital importance. A convent was established nearby, and sure enough missionaries, explorers, and eventually colonist would stream over the Rio Grande, come upon the new convent, and eventually go out into the region of Texas. On June 13, 1691, a group of Spanish explorers and missionaries finally came upon the Payaya Settlement. As it happened to be the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua, they named the site San Antonio. In the early 18th century, attempts were made to befriend the Payaya natives, though they did not go well. Fray Antonio de Olivares was appointed to set up a mission (Misión de San Antonio de Valero, more famously known by a name that I can’t remember for some reason). However, following the establishment of the Alamo Mission, his work faltered due to him falling from a bridge and breaking his leg. Native attacks followed, and the Alamo Mission became the keystone for the entire Spanish Province of Tejas."

		"A century later, Mexico won its revolution, and invited many Anglo-american empresarios (including a certain Stephen Austin) to settle in the newly-minted Province of Texas to the northeast and east of San Antonio. After Antonio López de Santa Anna became president, adding yet (not) another Antonio to this historical narrative, violence erupted throughout Mexico, including in the province of Texas and in the city of San Antonio. “Texian” forces (what they called themselves before they realized that just “Texan” was better) wrested the San Antonio from the Mexican military, and forced them to retreat at the end of 1835. It was in the spring that Santa Anna led the Mexican army to confront Sam Houston’s Texian forces. Sam Houston retreated, believing that San Antonio could not be held against the Mexican army, but a volunteer force holed up in the old San Antonio mission. At what would become the Siege of the Alamo, the defenders held from February 23rd to March 6th 1836, during which time the Republic of Texas would officially be proclaimed. After twelve days of bombardment, Santa Anna finally stormed the Alamo mission, and captured and executed almost all the defenders. The cry “Remember the Alamo” became the rallying point of the Texan revolution, and a month and a half later the Texans won their independence at the Battle of San Jacinto."

		"Following the Texan Revolution and the subsequent inclusion into the United States, the Alamo became the focal point of the growing San Antonio. Many ethnic Germans, Africans, and Mexicans inhabited the city (the Germans due to the German revolutions, the Africans due to freedmen, and the Mexicans because they lived there the whole time), and so during the American Civil War most of the city’s residents quietly supported the Union rather than the pro-slave cause. Towards the end of the 19th century, San Antonio became the center of Cattle-culture, spawning a generation of legendary Cowboys. San Antonio was isolated and remained on the American Frontier, an amalgam of culture and language that somehow resembled New Orleans. That, combined with the gunfighters, robbers, and cowboys of the Old West gave the city an air of ruggedness and mystique that attracted tourists. In particular, the city is associated with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
